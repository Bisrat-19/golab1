## Activity 1: Setting Up and Running a Go Program
**Reflection:**  
I learned how to install and configure Go, create a simple Go file, and run it using the `go run` command. I also understood that every Go program must have a `main()` function as its entry point.

---

## Activity 2: Variables and Data Types
**Reflection:**  
I learned how to declare and initialize variables using both the `var` keyword and the shorthand `:=`. I explored different data types like `int`, `float64`, `string`, and `bool`, and understood how Go infers types automatically.

---

## Activity 3: Functions and Control Flow
**Reflection:**  
I practiced writing custom functions, using `if-else` for decision-making, and `for` loops for repetition. I understood how functions make code reusable and how control flow structures help organize logic.

---

## Activity 4: Arrays, Slices, and Maps
**Reflection:**  
I learned about Go’s collection types — arrays, slices, and maps. I practiced adding and looping through elements using `range`, and understood the difference between fixed-size arrays and dynamic slices.

---

## Activity 5: Goroutines (Concurrency Basics)
**Reflection:**  
I learned how to run functions concurrently using goroutines by adding the `go` keyword before a function call. This helped me understand Go’s powerful support for concurrency and parallel execution.

---

## Activity 6: Channels (Communicating Between Goroutines)
**Reflection:**  
I learned how goroutines communicate safely using channels. I understood how to send and receive data between goroutines and how to use `close(ch)` to signal that no more data will be sent.

---

## Activity 7: Error Handling and Defer
**Reflection:**  
I learned how to handle runtime errors using Go’s `error` type and how `defer` ensures that resources like files are properly closed even if an error occurs. This taught me the importance of clean and safe resource management.
